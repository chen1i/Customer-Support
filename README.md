# Custom Support App

An example app comes from J2EE book "Professional Java for Web Applications"

I merged these iterated versions from each chapter into one git repo and sharing here.

Feel free to use it.

## Prerequisite

Intellij IDEA (version 14+ is recommended)
Apache Tomcat 8.0 (latest is better)

## Usage

1. git clone \<this repo\>
1. config this in a web container (tomcat)
1. use browser to visit http://localhost:8080/support
